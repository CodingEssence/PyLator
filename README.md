# PyLator

A translator for all your need for all your needs, whether you need to translate something for some reason, or for your school!

Easy to use, it will first initialize (Just to make it cooler), then it will ask you which language you want to translate __to__. Then it will ask you which language you want to translate __from__.

Then input your text and press enter, and it will translate.

Example:
The initializing part:

The first part:

And at the end, it will ask to do it again or not. `y` or `yes` to continue, or anything else to terminate the program
